Project: Mini Motorways Solver

Project started in May first week
WEEK 1
The first week was based on git/github. Resources were provided to learn all the necessary aspects of version control using git.
Concepts like creating new files, staging environment, commit, branch on git was discussed. 
Biggest takeaway was using git to clone a fork from github and after working on it, pushing the changes back to github and sending a pull request to the main project repository.
Here, a task was given, where I had add the resources material in the README.md file of the Material branch, commiting and pushing those changes to my fork. After sending a pull request, the changes were merged to the main repo

WEEK 2
In this week, Python as the main programming language was discussed. Here, basic concepts like data types, conditional statements, looping, iterators , functions and classes was discussed.

Here, an assignment was given, where I had to solve python problems with the task of writing smallest possible code and the most efficient code possible. This was helpful in getting comfortable with python.

WEEK 3
In this week, Graphs was discussed. A sound understanding of graph theory is imperative for this project. Resources were provided where concepts like stacks, queues and priority queues were discussed. Graph Traversal Algorithm like Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) was also discussed.
For the assignment in this week, I was assigned with implementing DFS algorithm. This was done to reduce the number of nodes and edges in the graph. DFS is implemented by using Stacks and, all the nodes were traversed. If a node with 1 or at least 3 roads connecting to it is encountered, that node is assigned. For various paths, edge is added and weight is equal to the length of the path.
I sent a pull request for this code, which has been merged into the main project repo.

WEEK 4
This week dealt with learning about the game, Mini Motorways Solver. Here, I was assigned to analyze the diamond cell and roundabout. 
We had to create certain scenarios in the game, and note the various observations regarding traffic jams,various entry and exit points for the cars, different paths undertaken by cars. These information is critical to code and model the various road structures in the game.

WEEK 5
This week dealt with theoritical understanding of ML and how it can be implemented to this project. Resouces provided gave a deep understanding for various ML concepts using probability theory and linear algebra. 
Various tasks were assigned, and observations were made on what features of the game can be relevant to the model, and the data points necessary. 

WEEK 6
In this week, various libraries and their documentation were provided like Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn and Tensorflow

WEEK 7
In this week, data assembling was discussed, where raw information like cell positioning, positions of various road structures like diamond cell, roundabouts etc. were mentioned. The analysis done in week 4 is used here.
Here, I was assigned with the structures diamond cell and roundabouts.

WEEK 8
In this week, material for neural networks was given. Neural Networks architecture tensorflow is relevant to the project and its documentation and tutorial was provided.
